This README will make your GitHub repo **look professional and complete**—anyone can clone, set up, and run it.  

If you want, I can also **create a complete ready-to-push folder structure** with all HTML, CSS, JS, and `app.py` properly linked so you can just push to GitHub in one go.  

Do you want me to do that next?
